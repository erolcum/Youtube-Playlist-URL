Video names are shortened on the right.. 
URL is like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv4nsxR_pRo&list=PL6I0F5vxE0QIBnqM_CMmktNFgCgcsXvzw<br>
To view the playlist more comfortably, you should write **playlist?** from the first "/" to "/list" in URL like :<br>
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6I0F5vxE0QIBnqM_CMmktNFgCgcsXvzw<br>
